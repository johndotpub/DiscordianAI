## [v0.2.6] - 2025-01-25

### Fixed
- **ðŸ”— Citation Hyperlinks**: Fixed Perplexity citations not rendering as clickable links in Discord
  - **Root Cause**: Discord only supports `[text](url)` hyperlinks in embeds, not regular messages
  - **API Discovery**: Perplexity API now provides citations in `citations` metadata field, not inline URLs
  - **Solution**: Implemented Discord embeds with citation metadata extraction for proper hyperlink formatting
  - **Result**: Citations now appear as clickable hyperlinks: `[[1]](https://source.com)`
- **ðŸ“± Message Splitting with Embeds**: Enhanced message splitting to properly handle Discord embeds
  - Embed with citations attached to first message part
  - Continuation messages sent as plain text
  - Preserves citation accessibility for long responses

### Added  
- **`CitationEmbedFormatter` Class**: New utility for creating Discord embeds with properly formatted citations
- **Enhanced Citation Processing**: Modern Perplexity API support with `citations` and `search_results` metadata extraction
- **Comprehensive Citation Tests**: 17 new tests covering end-to-end citation functionality
- **Debug Scripts**: Added `/scripts` folder with debugging utilities for citation testing
- **Smart Embed Decision Logic**: Automatically determines when to use embeds vs plain text

### Changed
- **Perplexity Response Format**: Now returns `(text, suppress_embeds, embed_data)` tuple
- **Citation Extraction**: Updated to use Perplexity API metadata fields instead of inline URL parsing
- **Message Sending Pipeline**: Updated to handle both text messages and embeds seamlessly  
- **Citation Display**: Citations only appear in embeds for Perplexity responses (OpenAI remains plain text)
- **Dependencies**: Updated to `discord.py>=2.6.2` and `openai>=1.101.0`

### Technical Details
- **Modern API Support**: Handles both `citations` array and `search_results` objects from Perplexity API
- **Discord Embed Limits**: Properly handles 4096 character description limit
- **Backward Compatibility**: Non-citation responses continue using plain text
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to plain text if embed creation fails
